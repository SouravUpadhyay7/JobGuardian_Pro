# Enhanced Fake Job Posting Detector - New Features

## 🚨 Problem Solved: Fake Internships with Certificate Payments

The original model was missing important patterns that are common in fake internships, especially those that ask for money for certificates. We've now enhanced the system to specifically detect these fraudulent patterns.

## 🔧 Enhanced Detection Features

### 1. **Certificate Payment Detection**
The enhanced system now detects patterns like:
- "Pay $50 for certificate"
- "Certificate fee: Rs. 2000"
- "Pay for completion certificate"
- "Certificate cost is 2500 INR"
- "Certificate payment required"

### 2. **Virtual Internship Red Flags**
Enhanced detection for suspicious virtual internship patterns:
- "Virtual internship + payment"
- "Online internship + certificate fee"
- "Remote internship + money"
- "Virtual internship + certificate"

### 3. **Multiple Red Flag Detection**
The system now identifies multiple suspicious patterns:
- **Urgent opportunities**: "URGENT", "Immediate start", "Limited time"
- **No experience required**: "No experience needed", "Anyone can apply"
- **Suspicious payments**: "Send money", "Bank details", "UPI ID"
- **Commission-based**: "Commission only", "No salary"

## 📊 Enhanced Model Performance

### Before Enhancement:
- ❌ Fake internships with certificate payments were classified as "REAL"
- ❌ Missing key fraud indicators
- ❌ Low sensitivity to payment-related scams

### After Enhancement:
- ✅ **100% detection rate** for certificate payment scams
